1. Gas is not ideal -> That's a modelling error (deliberate)
2. Gas may not be saturated
3. The various thermodynamic processes may not be happening at is-X
   values. (X - entropic, enthalpic etc.)

Other errors because of quality of measurement (for example point estimation 
of bulk (non-mixed) volume of liquid etc), the devices used in the cycle may
not be 100% efficient at what they do.
What else?
And how relevant is one error compared to another?
And in the given context, does it matter?

All of these errors would deviate us from the ideal behavior. 

So, the simulation of the values of pressures and temperatures 
would need to introduce these errors into the values we would get 
if the system were ideal.
