Vapor Refrigeration Cycle
--

Goal is to maintain a low temperature system by rejecting heat 
from it to the surrounding (which would be at a higher temperature).

2nd Law of Thermodynamics prohibits doing this without doing work.
A Vapor Refrigeration cycle is used to achieve that.


Parts
--

1. Compressor
2. Condensor
3. Expansion Valve
4. Evaporator / Refrigerated Space (where we cool objects)


Cycle:
	=>           
	+---- Compressor -------+
	|			|
	|			|
	|			|

   Evaporator              Condensor

COP of refridgerator is defined as = heat absorbed by refridgerant / work done
				   = Q_a / W_in

Questions:
--

1. How long do I need to wait to achieve a 10/15/20C etc. change in evaporator?
2. How much would that cost?
3. Also, How much water can I cool in that period?

Context:
--
	Lets say you are a cold water supply company:
	Your input water comes from an open lake nearby at X degree celcius (it can vary) and
	your customer desires Y degree celcius (Y < X) of water.
	What factors would affect your cost? And how do you achieve profitablity?
	1. How long would the factory be functioning per day?
	2. What is the consumption like (does it vary a lot or stays constant more or less)?
	
	Want to figure out:
	1. Phrased as above, I need to know how much it will cost me to produce 
	   at that level and temperature.
	2. Suppose the customer is willing to pay M per kg of output (market rate, fixed), will I be
	   profitable? How much output would I need to generate?
	3. Now if X begins to vary, how will I adjust my output / or desired temperature?
