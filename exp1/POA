1. Assume that after the final temp of outlet streams are the same (= T_f).
2. find T_f From the balance equation.
3. Now, calculate U and effectiveness.
4. These are theoretical values. We compare to this
==== DONE ====

==== TODO ====
1. Pick an appropriate error distribution (cross check with value like effectiveness (always < 1))
2. Compute U and e 
3. F correction factor

Now repeat 1-7 for different flow rates and DTC, CWT temperatures.
