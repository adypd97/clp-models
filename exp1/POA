1. Assume that after the final temp of outlet streams are the same (= T_f).
2. find T_f From the balance equation.
3. Now, calculate U and effectiveness.
4. These are theoretical values. We compare to this
5. Assume a 15% error margin on final temperatures (of the outlets)
6. Compute new U and effectiveness values.
7. Compare them to the theoretical values.

Now repeat 1-7 for different flow rates and DTC temperatures.
